# sounding-board
My humble repository of sounds and sights.
I am an associate professor of African American Studies and English Literature at New Jersey City University. I teach African Diasporic literatures, digital humanities, hip hop, and film. 
I am also the Director of the Lee Hagan Africana Studies Center and Coordinator of the African and African American Studies Program.
